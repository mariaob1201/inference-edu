knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

## Simulation Parameters

```{r parameters}
# Parameters
lambda <- 0.2  # rate parameter of the exponential distribution
n <- 40  # number of exponentials in each sample
simulations <- 1000  # number of simulations

# Theoretical mean and variance of the sample means
theoretical_mean <- 1 / lambda
theoretical_variance <- (1 / lambda)^2 / n  # Variance of the sample mean
```

## Simulation Results

```{r simulation}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Simulate the data: 1000 simulations, each with 40 exponential values
sample_means <- replicate(simulations, mean(rexp(n, lambda)))

# Sample mean of the sample means
mean_sample_means <- mean(sample_means)
variance_sample_means <- var(sample_means)

# Print results
cat("Sample Mean of Sample Means:", mean_sample_means, "\n")
cat("Variance of Sample Means:", variance_sample_means, "\n")
cat("Theoretical Mean:", theoretical_mean, "\n")
cat("Theoretical Variance:", theoretical_variance, "\n")
```

## Visualizations

### Distribution of Sample Means

```{r sample_means_plot}
# Plot the distribution of sample means
hist(sample_means, probability = TRUE, 
     main = "Distribution of Sample Means",
     xlab = "Sample Mean", 
     col = "lightblue", 
     border = "black")

# Add the theoretical normal curve to the histogram
curve(dnorm(x, mean = theoretical_mean, sd = sqrt(theoretical_variance)),
      add = TRUE, col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

### Distribution of Individual Exponentials

```{r individual_exponentials_plot}
# Plot the distribution of individual exponentials
individual_exponentials <- rexp(simulations * n, lambda)
hist(individual_exponentials, probability = TRUE, 
     main = "Distribution of Individual Exponentials",
     xlab = "Exponential Value", 
     col = "lightgreen", 
     border = "black")
```

## Conclusion

This simulation demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem for exponential distributions, showing how sample means converge to a normal distribution with the expected theoretical mean and variance.
